					enum week{Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};
					// by default the first value is 0, the values are incremented by 1 after that 
					// one or more values can be declared explicitly
					enum week{Monday = 1, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};
					//in this example Monday is declared as 1 and the values of following declarations will be incremented by 1.
